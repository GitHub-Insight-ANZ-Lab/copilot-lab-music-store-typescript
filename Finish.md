# Wrapping things up!

So there we have it - you've built your first Copilot-assisted application!

In this short workshop you have hopefully identified how Copilot can help you be a more productive developer and solve problems in a much shorter period of time.

If you reflect back your time, what are the top two learnings you'll take away?!

Until our next workshop, have fun using Copilot!
