# Step 2: Extending the Node.js Express TypeScript API

In this step, we will be using GitHub Copilot to create TypeScript interfaces that represent the models for the music store. We will create `Genre`, `Artist`, and `Album` interfaces. We will also generate a mock data file and create a music store service with methods for listing all genres, getting all albums by genre name, and getting an album by its id. Finally, we will create the relevant controller and routes.

Before we begin, we will add hot reloading, which will speed up the development process.

## Adding Hot Reloading

Hot reloading can speed up your development process by automatically restarting your application whenever file changes are detected. We'll use GitHub Copilot to guide us through adding this functionality.

1. Open your `package.json` file where you want to add hot reloading.

2. Go to Copilot Chat and ask how you could add hot reloading to your API. For example, you could type: `How do I add hot reloading to a Node.js Express application?`

3. Copilot should suggest using a package like `nodemon` to add hot reloading.

4. Follow the steps suggested by Copilot to install `nodemon` and modify your `package.json` scripts section to use `nodemon`.

Remember, you can always ask Copilot for help if you get stuck. For example, you can ask: "How do I install nodemon?" or "How do I modify the npm start script to use nodemon?"

## Creating TypeScript Models

Lets start by creating our TypeScript models that will represent our music store.

1. Select the `models` folder in your API project, right click, select `New File...` and name the new file `genre.ts`.

2. In the new file press `CTRL + I` and type a prompt to generate your `Genre` interface, for example you could type: `Exported interface that represents my genre model with properties id & name`. The result should look something like this:
    ```TypeScript
    export interface Genre {
        id: number;
        name: string;
    }
    ```

3. Repeat the above steps for the `Artist` & `Album` models. Play around with the prompts and see if Copilot will make suggestions of properties for you.

Alternatively you can ask Copilot in the chat: `How do I create TypeScript interfaces for a music store with genres, artists, and albums?` and see what results you get.

## Generating Mock Data

Next we will create some mock data for our API using inline Copilot code completion.

1. Create a folder named `data` and add a file named `musicStoreMockData.ts`.

2. In the file start by typing a comment as our next prompt, we can add plenty of detail to get good mock data. You might need to start the first line for `genres` to get it started, for example:
    ```TypeScript
    // Mock data for the music store API, includes a list of genres, artists and albums
    // The data should be real genres, artists and albums, examples are artists like Pink Floyd, The Beatles and Led Zeppelin
    export const genres: Genre[] = [
    ```
3. Repeat the above steps for `artists` & `albums`. If the generated data is incorrect you can highlight the block of code, press `CTRL + I` to ask Copilot to make any required changes.

### ðŸš©Wait a minute?!

When you generate the Albums, do you get an incomplete result, or no result? Why is that?!

You are hitting the token limit for GitHub Copilot's model [Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex). Token limits include any prompt you send to the model asking it for a response. Have a read of this [great post](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/azure-ai-services-blog/15-tips-to-become-a-better-prompt-engineer-for-generative-ai/ba-p/3882935), paying attention to item number 8 on the list!

Tidy up your incomplete Albums array, or use Copilot to add new entries one at a time.

## Creating the Music Store Service

Now, create a new file for your music store service. This service should have methods for listing all genres, getting all albums by a genre name, and getting an album by its id. You can ask Copilot in the chat: "How do I create a service with methods for listing all genres, getting all albums by genre name, and getting an album by its id in TypeScript?"

## Creating the Controller and Routes

Finally, create a new file for your controller and routes. The controller should use the methods from the music store service to handle requests and send responses. The routes should define the endpoints for your API. You can ask Copilot in the chat: "How do I create a controller and routes for a music store API in Express?"

Remember to use a mix of inline Copilot code completion and Copilot chat to complete this step. Happy coding!
