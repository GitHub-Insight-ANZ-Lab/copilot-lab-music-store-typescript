# Step 2: Extending the Node.js Express TypeScript API

In this step, we will be using GitHub Copilot to create TypeScript interfaces that represent the models for the music store. We will create `Genre`, `Artist`, and `Album` interfaces. We will also generate a mock data file and create a music store service with methods for listing all genres, getting all albums by genre name, and getting an album by its id. Finally, we will create the relevant controller and routes.

## Creating TypeScript Interfaces

Start by creating a new file in your project to store your interfaces. You can ask Copilot in the chat: "How do I create TypeScript interfaces for a music store with genres, artists, and albums?"

## Generating Mock Data

Next, create a new file to store your mock data. You can use the inline Copilot code completion to help you generate good mock data for your interfaces. Remember to add comments to your code to explain what each part does.

## Creating the Music Store Service

Now, create a new file for your music store service. This service should have methods for listing all genres, getting all albums by a genre name, and getting an album by its id. You can ask Copilot in the chat: "How do I create a service with methods for listing all genres, getting all albums by genre name, and getting an album by its id in TypeScript?"

## Creating the Controller and Routes

Finally, create a new file for your controller and routes. The controller should use the methods from the music store service to handle requests and send responses. The routes should define the endpoints for your API. You can ask Copilot in the chat: "How do I create a controller and routes for a music store API in Express?"

Remember to use a mix of inline Copilot code completion and Copilot chat to complete this step. Happy coding!
